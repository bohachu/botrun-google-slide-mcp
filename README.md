# Google Slides MCP Server

## Description

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Google Slides API. It allows you to create, read, modify, and manage Google Slides presentations programmatically through a secure service account authentication method.

## Quick Start for Gemini CLI (Primary Method)

### Complete Setup Instructions

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up the Google Slides MCP server with Gemini CLI:

1. **Create working directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/coding_projects/working
   ```

2. **Navigate to working directory**
   ```bash
   cd ~/coding_projects/working
   ```

3. **Create keys directory for Google service account**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/coding_projects/working/keys
   ```

4. **Copy your Google service account key**
   - Drag and drop your `google_service_account_key.json` file to the directory: `~/coding_projects/working/keys`
   - Make sure the file is named exactly `google_service_account_key.json`

5. **Create .env file with Gemini API key**
   ```bash
   vi ~/coding_projects/working/.env
   ```
   - Press `i` to enter insert mode
   - Type: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`
   - Press `ESC`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save and exit

6. **Create MCP configuration directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/coding_projects/working/.gemini
   ```

7. **Configure MCP settings**
   ```bash
   vi ~/coding_projects/working/.gemini/settings.json
   ```
   - Press `i` to enter insert mode
   - Insert the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "google-slides-mcp": {
         "command": "google-slides-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Press `ESC`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save and exit

8. **Install the Google Slides MCP server globally**
   
   Remember to execute this command in your terminal first:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @bohachu/google-slides-mcp
   ```
   This installs the remote MCP server to your local machine globally, making it executable from any path.

9. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   gemini -y
   ```
   You should now see that the Google Slides MCP server environment is installed and ready to use.

### Quick Setup (After Initial Installation)

Once you've completed the initial setup, for subsequent use you only need:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Install the MCP server globally:
```bash
npm install -g @bohachu/google-slides-mcp
```

Then edit `~/.gemini/settings.json` to add the Google Slides MCP server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-slides-mcp": {
      "command": "google-slides-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The service account key file must be present at `keys/google_service_account_key.json` relative to your working directory when using Gemini CLI.

### 2. Set up Google Service Account Authentication

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Slides API:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & services"
   - Click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES"
   - Search for "Google Slides API" and enable it
4. Create Service Account credentials:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "Service account"
   - Fill in the service account details
   - Click "Create" and "Done"
5. Download the service account key:
   - Click on your newly created service account
   - Go to the "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
   - Choose "JSON" as the key type
   - Click "Create" to download the JSON file
6. **Important:** Rename the downloaded file to `google_service_account_key.json` and place it in a `keys` directory in your current working directory

### 3. Use with Gemini CLI

Once configured, you can use the Google Slides tools directly in Gemini CLI. The MCP server will be automatically loaded when you start Gemini.

## Other Installation Methods
